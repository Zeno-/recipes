---
_By Zeno`_

# Ingredients
* 1 whole chicken (approx. 1.5kg)
* 100g dried apricots
* 100g green olives
* 4 cloves garlic
* 1 tbsp capers
* 2 tbsp red wine vinegar
* 2 tbsp dry sherry
* 1 cup (250ml) white wine (approx)
* 2 tbsp brown sugar
* 1/4 cup almond meal
* 2 tsp dried oregano
* 1 tbsp ghee (or clarified butter)
* Salt
* Black pepper

# Method
1. Reserve 90ml (6 tbsp) of the white wine
2. Roughy chop the dried apricots, green olives and garlic; in a blender, blend along with the capers until a rough paste is formed
3. Add red wine vinegar, dry sherry, reserved white wine and the brown sugar to the paste prepared in the previous step
4. In a bowl, thoroughly combine the paste, the almond meal, the dried oregano. The mixture should be moist but holding together -- add more almond meal if necessary. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
5. Stuff the paste/stuffing under the skin of the chicken on top of the breast. For a 1.5kg chicken it should be possible to use the entire amount without breaking the skin; if not, place any excess in the cavity
6. Clean and dry the chicken skin with kitchen paper
7. Massage ghee over the entire chicken and generously season with salt and freshly cracked black pepper
8. Roast in a 200C oven for 20-30 minutes; reduce heat to 180C for the remainder of the cooking period
9. Throughout the cooking period (after the first 45 minutes) pour the remaining white wine over the chicken at intervals
10. When cooked, let rest for at least 15 minutes and prepare gravy using the pan juices
