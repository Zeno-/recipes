title: Apricot Roast Chicken
---
_By Zeno`_

# Ingredients
* 1 whole chicken (approx. 1.5kg)
* 100g dried apricots
* 100g green olives
* 4 cloves garlic
* 1 tbsp capers
* 2 tbsp red wine vinegar
* 2 tbsp dry sherry
* 1 cup (250ml) white wine (approx)
* 2 tbsp brown sugar
* 1/4 cup almond meal
* 2 tsp dried oregano
* 1 tbsp ghee (or clarified butter)
* Salt
* Black pepper

# Method
1. Reserve 90ml (4 tbsp) of the white wine
2. Roughy chop the dried apricots, green olives and garlic; in a blender, chope these with these along with the capers until a rough paste is formed
3. Add red wine vinegar, dry sherry, reserved white wine and the brown sugar to the paste prepared in the previous step
4. In a bowl, thoroughly combine the paste, the almond meal, the dried oregano and salt and pepper to taste (the mixture should be moist but holding together -- add more almond meal if necessary)
5. Stuff the paste/stuffing under the skin of the chicken (on top of the breast). For a 1.5kg chicken you should be able to get in all under there; if there is any excess put it in the cavity
6. Clean and dry the chicken skin with kitchen paper
7. Massage the ghee over the entire chicken
8. Generously season the skin with salt and freshly cracked black pepper
9. Roast in a 200C oven for 20-30 minutes; reduce heat to 180C for the remainder of the cooking period
10. Throughout the cooking period (after the first 45 minutes) pour the remaining white wine over the chicken at intervals
11. When cooked let rest for at least 15 minutes and prepare gravy using the pan juices
